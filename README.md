This repository contains all the project I made in Web application.  
  
In this class,  I started by getting familiar with HTML and CSS, for the front-end Design, then using ASP.NET to implement functional web application, and know how to manipulate SQL database so as XML and Ajax.
  
Basically they are all done using ASP.NET and C# on Visual Studio 2015.
